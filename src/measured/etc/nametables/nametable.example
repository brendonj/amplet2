# AMP nametable
#
# Any file in this directory that ends with '.name' is treated as a nametable
# file, describing mappings of name to IP address, similar in approach to
# /etc/hosts. This allows the use of names to refer to test targets without
# involving DNS lookups. The mappings from all '.name' files in this
# directory are combined together with those in the client specific
# subdirectories (named after the client ampname) to create the complete
# nametable for an instance of the amplet2 client.
#
# These mappings are read in when amplet first starts and also whenever
# it receives a SIGHUP signal. Using the "reload" option to the init script
# will send a SIGHUP to a running amplet.
#
# Duplicate names and IP addresses are allowed. If a name has multiple
# addresses associated with it then this will behave the same as if the name
# was resolved using DNS and multiple addresses were returned.
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# amp-foo 192.0.2.1
# amp-foo 192.0.2.2
# amp-foo 2001:DB8::4
# amp-bar 192.0.2.100
# target.example.com 192.0.2.250
# ipv6-target.example.com 2001:DB8::1
