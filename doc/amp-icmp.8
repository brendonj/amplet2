.SH NAME
amp-icmp \- AMP standalone ICMP ECHO_REQUEST test
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBamp-icmp\fR [\fB-hrx\fR] [\fB-p \fImilliseconds\fB\fR] [\fB-s \fIpacketsize\fB\fR] [\fB-I \fIiface\fB\fR] [\fB-4 \fIaddress\fB\fR] [\fB-6 \fIaddress\fB\fR] [\fB-Z \fImicroseconds\fB\fR] -- \fIdestination1\fR [\fIdestination2\fR \fI...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBamp-icmp\fP is the standalone version of the \fBamplet2\fP(8)
ICMP ECHO_REQUEST test. It is very similar in function to \fBping\fR(8),
except that it can
test to multiple destinations simultaneously. All destinations listed on the
command line will be tested to. Any destinations that are hostnames will be
resolved, and every address that they resolve to will be tested.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Show summary of options.
.TP
\fB-I, --interface \fIiface\fB\fR
Specifies the interface (device) that tests should use when sending packets.
By default the interface will be selected according to the routing table.
.TP
\fB-p, --perturbate \fImilliseconds\fB\fR
Delay the test by a random number of milliseconds, up to a maximum of \fImilliseconds\fR. The default is to not perturbate tests (no delay).
.TP
\fB-r, --random\fR
Use a random packet size for each test.
.TP
\fB-s, --size \fIpacketsize\fB\fR
Specifies the total number of bytes to be sent per packet (including headers).
The default is 84 bytes.
.TP
\fB-v, --version\fR
Show version of program.
.TP
\fB-x, --debug\fR
Enable extra debugging output.
.TP
\fB-Z, --interpacketgap \fImicroseconds\fB\fR
Minimum number of microseconds between sending probe/query packets.
.TP
\fB-4, --ipv4 \fIa.b.c.d\fB\fR
Specifies the source IPv4 address that tests should use when sending packets to
IPv4 targets. This address must belong to one of the interfaces.
By default the IPv4 address of the outgoing interface will be used.
.TP
\fB-6, --ipv6 \fIa:b:c:d:e:f:g:h\fB\fR
Specifies the source IPv6 address that tests should use when sending packets to
IPv6 targets. This address must belong to one of the interfaces.
By default the IPv6 address of the outgoing interface will be used.
