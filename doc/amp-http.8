.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBamp-http\fP is the standalone version of the \fBamplet2\fP(8)
HTTP fetch test. Given a URL to a webpage it will fetch the page and most of
the other content required to properly display it - CSS, images, javascript,
etc. It will however not parse javascript, so won't fetch objects from URLs
that are constructed programatically.
