.SH NAME
amplet2 \- AMP measurement daemon


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBamplet2\fR [\fB-dhrvx\fR] [\fB-c \fIconfig\fR] [\fB-I \fIiface\fR] [\fB-4 \fIaddress\fR] [\fB-6 \fIaddress\fR] [\fB-Z \fImicroseconds\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBamplet2\fP is the process responsible for scheduling the tests to other
machines in the AMP mesh, or to nominated ad-hoc targets. It can also run
servers for tests that require cooperation from an end host to perform, such
as throughput tests.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-c, --config \fIconfig\fR
Read configuration information from the file \fIconfig\fR. The default
configuration file is /etc/amplet2/client.conf.


.TP
\fB-d, --daemonise\fR
Detach and daemonise the process.


.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Show summary of options.


.TP
\fB-I, --interface \fIiface\fR
Specifies the interface (device) that tests should use when sending packets.
By default the interface will be selected according to the routing table.


.TP
\fB-r, --noremote\fR
Do not attempt to update test schedules from a remote server.


.TP
\fB-v, --version\fR
Show version of program.


.TP
\fB-x, --debug\fR
Enable extra debugging output.


.TP
\fB-Z, --interpacketgap \fImicroseconds\fR
Minimum number of microseconds between sending probe/query packets.


.TP
\fB-4, --ipv4 \fIa.b.c.d\fR
Specifies the source IPv4 address that tests should use when sending packets to
IPv4 targets. This address must belong to one of the interfaces.
By default the IPv4 address of the outgoing interface will be used.


.TP
\fB-6, --ipv6 \fIa:b:c:d:e:f:g:h\fR
Specifies the source IPv6 address that tests should use when sending packets to
IPv6 targets. This address must belong to one of the interfaces.
By default the IPv6 address of the outgoing interface will be used.

.SH SECURITY
While \fBamplet2\fR can be run unprivileged, many of the tests that it performs
require higher level access. \fBamplet2\fR will need CAP_NET_RAW capability to
run any test that uses raw sockets (icmp, traceroute, tcpping, fastping).
